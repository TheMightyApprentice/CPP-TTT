# CPP-TTT
Contains the cpp files for a one to two player game of tic-tac-toe built in C++.

-The game will first ask for one or two players.
-If one player mode is selected, an "ai" will be used to compete against the player (at the moment imagine an easy level ai).
-If two player mode is selected, the program will take turns prompting each player for their selection.
-If the space is already filled, then they will receive a message and be prompted again for a new location.

-The board spaces (1-9) are with 1 - 3 being the top row, 4 - 6 the middle, and 7 - 9 the bottom.
-The "player" files hold all player actions (ai included).
-The "world" files hold all world actions like validating a player's chosen space and checking for a win condition.
-"tic-tac.cpp" is the main file.
-"game" is an executable that should already be able to run the game.
